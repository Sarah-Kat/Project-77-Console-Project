        <hr>
        <p>The console screen is like a screen to see outputs. If you'd like to print something, it would appear on the console screen. If you want to print something, youd type the command console.log. The console also works without code. if you directly typed something like 6+5, the console would give you your answer, in this case 11. The console asl oshows you the bigs in your code. It is used for outputs, and bugs. ot open it, double click on you site, click "inpect," and open the console tab.</p>

        <p>Open up the console to see the outputs of the mathmatical calculations, and the concatination of the two strings!</p>

            var full_name = first_name.concat(last_name);
            console.log(full_name);
            var num1 = 7;
            var num2 = 14;
            var add = num1 + num2;
            console.log(add);
            var subtract = num2 - num1;
            console.log(subtract);
            var multiply = num1 * num2;
            console.log(multiply);
            var divide = num2 / num1;
            console.log(divide);
